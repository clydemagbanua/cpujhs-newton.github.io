<strong><h3>3. Protagonist color don't matter - You are the protagonist of your story </h3></strong>
<p> Some people describes video games as a space whereupon whiteness is centered, lifted up, celebrated and imagined as always the heroic character; whereas other marginalized identities have been pushed aside and only imagined as criminals, terrorists, sexual objects and etc. In these games however, the stereotype has been diminished by centering 'different-colored' characters, storlines, histories as well as preserving and sharing their own culture.
